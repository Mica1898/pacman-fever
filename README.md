**TITLE: PacMen Exercise**

**Description:**
A web app that has tiny PacMen bouncing around the screen.

**How to Run:**
-Click the Add PacMen button, you can keep pressing the button to increase to quantity of PacMen on screen
-Press Start Game to make the PacMen move, you can keep pressing the button to increase the PacMen speed. 

**Roadmap for Future Improvements**
I am planning to add some HTML and CSS to style the DOM to make it look like an Arcade style game. I would also like to add a ghost button that introduces a ghost onto the DOM and the PacMen turn blue.
